              <h2 class="text-uppercase">New NUSMODS</h2>
              <p class="item-intro text-muted">Last edited on 10 November 2018 by Shengmin Yang.</p>
              <section id="Overview4">
                <h3 class="text-uppercase">Overview</h3>

                <p><span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight: bold;"> I </span> am a frequent user of NUSMODS. NUSMODS is a timetable tool widely used by NUS undergraduates to plan their modules. Although it has been continuously improved, it still lacks some important features that NUS students desire, such as adding reminders to the timetable and deriving a common time slot for a group of people. As users of the existing web application, we have also found common pain points amongst each other and amongst our friends. However, for the purpose of this project and the user-centered design approach we have adopted, we have made sure to detach ourselves as users, and adopt the designer hat.  </p>
                <p>We aim to add new convenient functions to NUSMODS to improve it as a tool for the planning for both academic and personal events, and to provide an integrated platform for NUS Students to organize their timetables. Additionally, our goal is to reduce the frustration that arises when students encounter certain problems like being unable to find a common slot with their friends or their timetables not being able to sync across multiple devices. </p>
                <p>The project started with the team brainstorming and coming up with plausible functions that can be incorporated into the new web application. The detailed functions are listed below. Initially, we have also decided to come up with a new name for the web application: NUS Moments. </p>
                <p>We came across the following new functions.</p>
                <p>Signing In/Out: The signing in and out function will mean that each nus email account is associated to a respective timetable on the web application. With this new feature, common problems like timetable discrepancies across multiple devices and browsers will be reduced. It also aids in some of our other functions like timetable comparisons and booking facilities. </p>
                <p>Timetable Comparison:The timetable comparison function enables easy comparison between different students’ timetables to list out common time slots. There will be two views: Comparing timetable with one person and comparing timetables with between 2-10 people. If the students want to have a discussion during a common slot, they can be directed to the booking facilities page to view available discussion rooms. </p> 
                <p>Book Facilities: One-click booking of sport facilities and study rooms will also be incorporated. Instead of struggling to get their various bookings via different websites, students can get all the troublesome work done at one common site. After a facility has been successfully booked, the booked time slot is automatically added to the booker’s timetable and optionally sent to his/her teammates through email. </p>
                <p>Study Groups and Interest Groups: Another function that we plan to put forward revolves around study groups, which facilitates discussion among students who are studying for the same module or external exam such as CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst). It is worth noting that students who have enrolled in modules alone may find it difficult to find a study partner. Although the “forum” function is available on IVLE for some modules, it is not popular or pervasive among students. Hopefully, the study group function can gather groups of like-minded individuals who are striving towards common academic goals. In the same vein, the interest group function gives students the opportunity to join either official NUS interest groups or unofficial meetups for sports, music or arts events. </p>
                <p>Add Your Own Event: Adding your own event was also raised as a useful function as it will provide a more accurate means of timetable comparison and students are able to add events like Consultations or external school related non-academic events. </p>
                <p>Reminder Function: Lastly, the vast number of events on the timetable, either academic or personal, necessitates the remainder function. Users can mark and receive reminders for the events they deem as important. </p>
                <p>Project Duration: The project duration is during Academic Year 18/19 Semester 1: September 2018 – November 2018.</p>
                <p>Tools Used: Balsamiq Mockups 3 | Sketch | Adobe XD | Visual Paradigm</p>
                <p>Based on the initial few functions that were derived, we proceeded to conduct interviews with current NUSMODS users and verified these findings through online surveys. </p>

              <section id="PreliminaryResearch">
                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Preliminary Research</h4>
                    <p>Before conducting an in-depth study of the problem, we performed a quick sanity check by asking others around us if they too face similar issues. Surprising, only a few had troubles with finding study groups, <b>but most have problems finding places for group meetings.</b></p>
                    <p>This is owed to the fact that senior students have a group of well-known friends to study with. Many students prefer to take the same modules as their friends. </p>
                    <p>We also visited the places where the discussion rooms are located and checked whether advance booking is required.</p>                    
              </section>
              <section id="UserResearch">
                <h3 class="text-uppercase">User Research</h3>
                <p>Target User: As our new project NUS Moments will be built upon the current NUSMODS whose users are mainly NUS students, the main user group for our website will largely be the same. We have identified two main user groups: undergraduate students and postgraduate students. Exchange students and visiting students are excluded from the user group, since their stay at NUS is too short for them to significantly benefit from NUSMODS and they have lower needs to plan for modules & set reminders for exams. Whilst different groups of students may have different usages and opinions of NUSMODS, we started out our project with user study in order to precisely define our target group.</p>
                <p>The research is structured as follows:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    
                    <li><b>i) Semi-structured interview</b>: Upon defining user groups, we carried out a series of interviews with 8 randomly selected NUS students across campus where we had them described their experiences with NUSMODS and their opinions on the proposed new features. The purpose of the interviews is to find out the current user experience for NUSMODS and areas in which they would like to see improvements in. </li>
   
                    <li><b>ii) Contextual Inquiry</b>: Following the semi-structured interviews, it is necessary to witness the behaviors of the users to confirm that the issues persist among them. Out of the 8 interviewees, 2 were randomly selected for contextual interview. We observed these two people using current NUSMODS and talking with their friends about the proposed new features. </li>

                    <li><b>iii) Surveys</b>: After analysing the interview results, we further surveyed 30 randomly selected NUSMODS users to validate our interview findings.</li>
                </ul>
              </section>
              
              <section id="SemiStructuredInterview">
                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Semi-structured Interview</h4>
                    <p>We started off the data analysis by consolidating all the interviews into one document and transcribed the main points from interview voice recordings so that it is easier to compare different responses and draw similarities. </p>
                    <p>Secondly, we took a closer look at the highlighted data by reading the interview transcripts for the different sections as well as cross checked each other’s interview responses in order to make sure that we did not miss or misinterpret anything. Then, we summarized the core findings on post-its in order to make an affinity diagram. After that, we drew the affinity diagram in sketch to make it more readable.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <figcaption> Figure 1: Original Affinity Diagram</figcaption>
                        <img src="images/ADorigin.png" class="responsive">
                    </figure>
                
                     <figure>
                        <figcaption> Figure 2: Affinity Diagram</figcaption> 
                        <img src="images/AD.png" class="responsive">
                    </figure>
                   
                    <p>We realised that postgraduate students rarely used NUSMODS based on their responses. Therefore, we narrowed down our target users to undergraduate students. Moreover, School of Medicine and School of Dentistry students are excluded from the study because the students we interviewed at these faculties do not use NUSMODS. These students follow special study plans with nearly fixed modules for each semester. Furthermore, most of their modules are not listed on NUSMODS.  </p>
                    <p>The affinity map we created from the interview results revealed to us some of the pain points and goals of the user. From the affinity map, we were able to categorize the data from the interview into key themes and sub themes. The 3 main big themes were Platform, New Functions and Current Features.</p>
                    <p>Platform: Interview results show a mixed opinion for having a mobile version. As users are currently hooked on the web application and have long established it to be the main source of timetable comparison, some have found it redundant to introduce a mobile application. In the interest of our timeline and resource allocation, we have decided as a group that our first phase of prototypes will be built on top of the web application. </p>
                    <p>New functions:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    
                    <li><b>i) Customization</b>: Interview results show that adding personal events would be convenient for some people, however many would prefer to use already existing applications such as Google Calendar. The reminder function is desired by many people, but it should be up to the user to decide on whether to enable a reminder for an event. </li>
   
                    <li><b>ii) Timetable Comparison</b>: Among all the new features we suggested to the interviewees, we expected comparing timetables for common slots to be the most welcomed one among the interviewees, To our surprise, many of the interviewees showed a neutral or even skeptical attitude towards this feature as some people are concerned with privacy. We have taken note of this and will integrate a solution to this concern in our new web application. </li>

                    <li><b>iii) Interaction</b>: Additionally, study group function is welcomed by some interviewees. However, others have concerns that it will make NUSMODS too social. Features such as browsing interest groups turned out to be not popular among the interviewees as many of them thought it deviates from the academics-centric purpose of NUSMODS. </li>

                    <li><b>iv) Facility Booking</b>: Booking discussion rooms received positive feedback as people are confused as to which website to book the facilities at. However, some interviewees had concerns about the technical feasibility. </li>

                </ul>
                    <p>Current Features: Our interview results reveal generally positive feedback on the current NUSMODS. Users appreciate the simple and minimalistic design and the functionality of allowing students to view which modules are available in the current/next semester and to derive a timetable from that. However, there is a general consensus that the module descriptions and reviews could be more updated, and we will take that into consideration as we move onto the next phase of our design process. </p>

              <section id="ContextualInquiry">
                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Conceptual Inquiry</h4>                  <p>Based on one contextual interview, we drew empathy map (Figure 2.3.2) for a NUSMODS user. She was with 2 friends when we observed and interviewed her. She discussed the new functions with her friends, tried to look for current websites for on-campus facility booking and responded to our interview questions. She found the existing facility booking to be quite troublesome and is glad to see all the bookings on one platform if possible.</p>

                    <p>The survey can be accessed <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfVpPrcznft-uvhnNK68Rkl31mzOg0g1nWa7PmKkta7goyDyQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" style="color:blue">here.</a> As our interview sample size is rather small which may not be representative of the large undergraduate student body, we sent out surveys to the mass undergraduate student body through social media to avoid biases and to validate our interview findings. We managed to get 30 responses from students in different faculties. Since ⅔ of the respondents come from Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Science and School of Computing. There concerns whether arts and business students are underrepresented.</p>

                    <p>Out of the 30 students we surveyed, around half (16) students use NUSMODS several times a month during the semester. 7 students use NUSMODS frequently during the bidding period but only about once a month during the semester since the bidding period is the most import time for module planning. The other 7 students are frequent users who use NUSMODS everyday throughout the semester. We expect an increase in frequency of usage after the new features are implemented.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>In the survey, the users were asked to rate each of the seven proposed functions. The possible choices range from “Extremely useful”, “Useful”, “Somewhat Useful”, “Neutral”. “Somewhat useless”, “Useless” to “Extremely useless”. The rating scale is designed to be symmetrical to minimize bias. </p>
                  
                    <figure>
                        <figcaption> Figure 6: Usefulness of 7 Proposed Functions</figcaption>
                        <img src="images/s3.png" class="responsive border">
                    </figure>
                    <p>We calculated the overall usefulness score for a function by this formula (denote the number of votes from “Extremely useful” to “Extremely useless” to be x_1 to x_7 respectively): <i>Overall score=x_1×3+x_2×2+x_3×1+x_4×0+x_5×(-1)+x_6×(-2)+x_7×(-3)</i></p>
                    <p>Survey results were generally consistent with what we gathered for interviews, but there were some differences (Figure 2.3.6). Although creating own account (overall score: 49) still remained as the most popular function, comparing timetable (Overall score: 48) became the second-most welcomed feature followed by booking campus facilities and reminders. Adding personal events to the timetable were not as well received as it was during interviews. Contrary to the rise in popularity of compare timetable function, the study group function lost its favor with overall score of only 18. Consistent with the interview results, interest group function is not welcomed by the respondents.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <figcaption> Figure 7: Overall Score for 7 Proposed Functions</figcaption>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Therefore, we first decided to keep the four features with highest votes for our project, namely: </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    
                    <li><b>i) Sign in/off NUSMODS with personal NUS email account </b> </li>
   
                    <li><b>ii) Compare timetables among friends </b></li>

                    <li><b>iii) Book on-campus facilities</b></li>

                    <li><b>iv) Send reminders for important events</b> </li>

                </ul>
                    <p><b>Justifying for the function (Add Personal Events):</b><br/>After that, we analyzed why users considered some functions to be extremely useful or useless. Specifically, users who consider the reminder function to be extremely useful indicated that they would like to have reminders for important project meetings. However, these personal events cannot be added to the timetable without implementing the add personal event function. Moreover, it would be troublesome if someone has a personal event on a common time slot derived by the compare timetable function. Hence, even though add personal events received overall score of only 35, it is a necessary function which two other important functions depend on. </p>
                    <p>Finally, we decided to implement the personal events function together with the reminder function. Another function we made changes before implementation is the book facilities function. Since most users would like NUSMODS to be concentrated solely on academic purposes, we decided to only implement discussion room booking. Integrating sports facility bookings into NUSMODS will dilute its identity as an academic tool. Moreover, some respondents consider study room booking as unnecessary because students can always study in libraries without any bookings.</p>
                    <p><b>Derived list of Features from User Analysis:</b><br/>Therefore, the final decision is to implement the following features</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    
                    <li><b>i) Sign in/off NUSMODS with personal NUS email account </b> </li>
   
                    <li><b>ii) Compare timetables among friends </b></li>

                    <li><b>iii) Book on-campus facilities</b></li>

                    <li><b>iv) Add personal events</b></li>

                    <li><b>v) Send reminders for important events</b> </li>

                </ul>
                    <p>Furthermore, many survey participants believe that after the new features have been implemented, NUSMODS will become an integrated platform to plan for events, thereby saving them the trouble of switching between multiple time and event management tools such as Desktop Calendar, Google Calendar and Eventbrite. </p>
                    <p><b>Other Constructive Feedback from Survey:</b><br/> Additionally, some constructive feedback by survey respondents on additional features they expect to see are listed below: </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    
                    <li>1.   Lighten color of tutorials that we do not have on that week since some tutorials are only held on even weeks. </li>
   
                    <li>2.  Be able to export to Google Calendar.</li>

                    <li>3.  More reviews or more inventive to write reviews/opportunity for anonymous reviews.</li>

                    <li>4.  Include module prerequisites and grading details for each module.</li>

                    <li>5.  Provide promptings for minor criteria. </li>

                    <li>6.  Suggest modules based on student’s specializations.</li>

                    <li>7.  Reflect all the modules that a student has taken before.</li>

                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Reflection</h4>
                    <p>The more straightforward part is coming up with new functions for NUSMODS initially. As we have encountered some inconvenience using NUSMODS, we are eager to make NUSMODS a better timetable-based tool. The more difficult part lies in finding participants for interviews and surveys. Since many busy people turned down our request to participate in the interviews or ignored our link for the survey, the results may be biased. We expected the compare timetable function to turn out to be users’ favorite function since all of us have suffered from manually comparing timetables with friends and group mates. However, as revealed by the user study, sign in with one’s own account is the most popular function with the highest overall score and the greatest number of users consider it as “extremely useful”. </p>
                    <p>We deem that we have asked an appropriate number of questions. If we reduce the number of questions, we may not get enough information on the users’ preferences. If we increase the number of questions, the questionnaire may become too long and take too much time to complete. The rating questions work best since the participants do not need to think up and write about their own ideas. These questions also enable us to perform analysis of the usefulness of the seven functions. The question about what the participants like about NUSMODS does not work as well as expected since most participants only mentioned about its look and did not delve deeper into its functions. The questions on why participants voted a proposed function to be “extremely useful” or “extremely useless” allow in-depth analysis and understanding of the underlying reasons why users like or dislike a particular proposed function.</p>
                    <p>From the user explanation, we are able to gain insights on whether users have a misunderstanding of our proposed functions, and then proceed to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed functions.</p>

                    <p>The low fidelity mockups were constructed with Balsamiq Mockups 3 in which black and white are the major colors used to minimize distraction. The main purpose of the low-fidelity prototypes is to test the usability of functions, not the look of the website. Hence, Balsamiq is a suitable tool for this design stage and helps us to achieve a balance between efficiency and effectiveness. When designing the low fidelity prototypes, we have also adopted Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics along the way and ensured to comply with some of the common usability guidelines.</p>
                    <p><b>Sign In/Out:</b><br/>Enable users to sign in NUSMODS with their NUS email accounts (Figure 11). NUS email account is used because of the security of NUS official database and necessity of one’s identity information when booking facilities. </p>

Users can manually close it by clicking on the cross at the top right corner or it would automatically dismiss in 5 seconds. Since the interface may not change much after the user signed in, we consider this pop-up window as a necessary measure to ensure the visibility of the system status (comply with H1 of Nielsen's heuristics) by giving users timely feedback. After signing in, the user’s name is shown on the top bar next to the “NUS Moments” logo (Figure 14). </p>

            <section id="Testing">
                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Testing</h4>
                    <p>After completion of our low fidelity prototype, we carried out with user testing to gather feedback for improvement before moving on to high-fidelity prototype.</p>
                    <p><b>Usability Testing Tasks:</b><br/> A list of tasks has been designed to evaluate the NUS Moment prototype with new functions.</p>
                    <p>Imagine you are an undergraduate who is using NUS Moment to perform a series of timetable-based tasks.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1.  Sign in with the following NUS email and password. Email: e0000001@u.nus.edu Password: NusEmail123   [Test the sign in function]</li>

                        <li>2.  You’re going to have an exam for CS3240 on Thursday afternoon 1pm November 29th. The venue is at MPSH2 and the exam is going to last for 1.5 hours. Please add this event to your timetable on NUS Moment.   [Test the add personal event function]</li>

                        <li>3.  In order not to forget your CS3240 exam, a reminder for it can be added. Please add a reminder for this exam and ask NUS Moment to remind you of it through SMS in the morning of November 29th.   [Test the reminder function]</li>

                        <li>4.  Suppose you have 3 project mates Jane, Joe and Mike. Their timetables are provided by us. Firstly, please add your modules to your timetable. Next, please create a group and ask your project mates to join. Then, please compare your timetable with theirs to find common time slots. If no common time slot is available, please ask NUS Moment to find a time slot with the most number of people available. After that, record the time slot and the number of people available.   [Test the find common time slot function]</li>

                        <li>5.  Suppose you want to book a discussion room at somewhere around School of Business for your project meeting. Click on the common time slot you found in task 4 to book a study room of suitable size to accommodate all the people who are going to participate in the meeting. Then, send invitations to your group mates to join the meeting so that they can add the meeting to their personal timetables.   [Test the facility booking function] </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p><b>User Scenario:</b><br/>Jessica Lim, a year-3 engineering undergraduate at NUS, uses NUSMODS several times a month throughout each semester. Together with 3 project teammates, she sits in front of a computer and she wants to use NUSMODS to book a discussion room for a group discussion. Firstly, she signs in NUSMODS to synchronize her timetable which she had already planned before. Before proceeding onto facility booking, she invited all teammates to join a group on NUSMODS. Next, she uses the “compare timetable” function to compare the timetables of all group members from next Monday to next Thursday to find a common time slot with the most number of people available. She also adds a minimum participant number restriction so only slots with greater than 3 people available are shown since no discussion will be held when too few people are available. After finding a satisfactory common time slot, she clicks on the “book room” button for that slot. She chooses the “logo view” for discussion rooms’ locations. Then, she clicks on Libraries and then selects Hon Sui Sen Memorial Library. After that, she is prompted to enter some basic information about the booking including a brief description of purpose. Finally, she submits the booking request and adds the project meeting as a personal event to her timetable. In order not to forget the meeting, she set a reminder for it.</p>
                    <p><b>Problems Identified with Expert Evaluation</b><p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1.  Group nearby places. Eg. A user who wants to book facilities at School of Computing may not mind booking at NUS Business School as well since these two places are close to each other.</li>
                        <li>2.  Should restrict the minimum number of people available for a common time slot. Showing common time slots with fewer than half of the group members available is not meaningful since people may not hold meeting in this case.</li>
                        <li>3.  How NUSMODS remind the users of events is not clear enough. The reminder should be able to catch user attention immediately i.e. center of the page. The best implementation is that users are notified even if they do not open NUSMODS.</li>
                        <li>4.  Typos may appear when one invites others to a group through email.</li>
                    </ul>  

                    <p><b>Problems Identified with Peer (CS3240 Classmates) Evaluation</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1.  There are privacy concerns as a friend’s matric number has to be entered so as to compare timetables for the “compare timetable – friend” function.</li>
                        <li>2.  The users’ privacy should always be guaranteed in the design, but it is not necessary to have a separate page for privacy policies since most people will not read it.</li>
                        <li>3.  Reminding the users through SMS is a good way since most people are always with their handphones.</li>
                        <li>4.  A function for the user to switch account may be needed because a user may lend his/her computer to a friend who does not bring computer and want to see the timetable on NUSMODS website.</li>
                        <li>5.  The design for buttons for different functions should be more consistent.</li>
                        <li>6.  Every user should have a basic profile including their name and major.</li>
                        <li>7.  Users should be allowed to set their own icon photos.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><b>Problems Identified with User Evaluation </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1.  The “Sign out” button stands out to be visually unappealing. It can be hidden under the user name.</li>
                        <li>2.  A simple user profile may be needed for people in the same group to better known each other.</li>
                        <li>3.  The profile should only include basic personal information due to concern of information leakage.</li>
                        <li>4.  Logo View page for booking facilities is unnecessary as close proximity between locations is illustrated through Map View.</li>
                        <li>5.  Display of headcounts in the room list view is confusing. Users did not get the hint that headcounts suggest room capacity.</li>
                        <li>6.  ‘My Booking’ tab takes too many clicks to reach and there is no master list of his/her past bookings for individual user. </li>
                        <li>7.  After a reminder is dismissed, a second reminder for the same event may be needed since there is time span between the first reminder and the event.</li>
                        <li>8.  Some users think that it is not necessary to show the logos for NUS facilities because they are already very familiar with these places.</li>
                        <li>9.  The name of ‘NUSMODS’ should be retained. Many users are confused by the name “NUS Moments” due to the similarity in the user interface design and they see NUS Moments as an upgraded version of NUSMODS. </li>
                        <li>10. For comparing timetables, asking users to key in individual matric numbers provides room for a lot of errors and should be improved on. </li>
                        <li>11. There is no need to differentiate between closed and secret group privacy for comparing timetables as they are largely the same. </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>With the results and insights gained from the low fidelity usability testing, we proceeded to improve these functions in our high-fidelity prototype. </p>

                </section>

                <section id="Highfid">
                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">High-fidelity</h4>
                    <p>The high fidelity prototypes are designed with Adobe XD which enables precise design with a wide range of colors and shapes. The main aspect that we have changed is the name NUS Moments back to NUSMODS as it ties in with the existing user’s mental models of the timetable management function with NUSMODS. Initially, we considered as NUS Moments as a timetable-based platform for students to do planning and socialize. However, since the social functions that were initially proposed such as interest group and study group were not implemented, our prototype is just an academic timetable management tool. Hence, we consider our prototype just as an enrichment of NUSMODS functions and abandoned the name “NUS Moments”. Changing the name would have been a mistake and would confuse some users. </p>

                    <p><b>Sign In</b><br/>The signing in page has been revised based on feedback for the low-fidelity prototype. Amendments include: Not being able to view timetable details, search for modules and add own events until the user has signed in (Figure 30). </p>

                    <figure>

                    </figure> 
                    <p>A pop-up window will be displayed after the user has successfully signed (Figure 31). In addition, “Reminder for today” is added to this window, thereby enabling the user to see reminders immediately after signing in. Only reminders that are due today at a time later than the user’s login time will be shown in this window. Once the user has signed in, he/she will be able to view all his/her timetable details and perform timetable management functions. </p>

                    <p>Upon logging in, the user’s name will be shown on the top bar next to the NUSMODS logo. After clicking on the user’s name, a small window with three main buttons: “Profile”, “Switch Account” and “Sign Out” will be shown.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p><b>View and Edit Profile:</b><br/>Based on suggestions from usability testing phase, users desire for basic personal profile which their group mates can view. They also want to have personal icons which easily differentiate themselves from others in the groups they have joined and during timetable comparison with friends. After clicking on “Profile”, a basic profile including the user’s name, faculty, year and major will be shown. </p>

                    <p>Moreover, the user can change his/her profile photo and set the privacy level of the profile & photo. As previously privacy was one of the key concerns raised by our target users, we give the users the choice to make their profile & photo visible to only oneself, “friends” (people involved in “compare timetable with friends” function), “friends + groups” (+ people in same groups with the user), or entirely public. The privacy settings for the profile and photo are separate so as to cater the needs of users who want to show one while hiding the other. </p>

                    <p><b>Switch Account:</b><br/>We also enabled the user to switch account, since some people may want to lend their computer to friends who want to sign in NUSMODS to check their timetables.</p>

                    <p><b>Facility Booking</b><br/>In our low fidelity prototype, we provided users two ways of selecting a location: Map View and Logo view. In Logo view, we group places of close geographical proximity together i.e. Business school and school of computing. This is to provide more options in the nearby areas for users who are not familiar with campus.</p>
                    <p>Based on the observation during user testing for low fidelity, most users used Map View instead of Logo View. Very few users explored Logo View feature. Our interview with users after the testing reveals that there are two reasons behind this: 1. Map View is the default page when user selects “Book Facilities” 2. By grouping rooms in two nearby areas together, it takes more time for them to look for a particular room which they had in mind already. However, we felt the feedback may be different for students who are not familiar with the campus. In, view of this, we conduct a few more testing with year 1 students or exchange students who are less familiar with the campus. To our surprise, the result stayed the same. These users also felt that Logo view is redundant as proximity between different colleges or libraries are obvious given the map view. Therefore we decided to remove Logo view page in our high fidelity design. User can click on any of the location to explore room choices.</p>

                    </figure> 
                    <p>The second change was made on the page where all rooms available in a particular location are displayed. In our low-fidelity design, individual room is displayed as a square with head counts inside indicating capacity which was reported to be confusing by users. Inconsistency in display for seminar rooms and discussion room further confused users. After explaining our design rationale with the users, they suggested that we should make it clearer that these headcounts indicate capacity of the room and standardize the design to prevent confusion. Therefore, in our high fidelity design, we modified it into a standard list view of all available rooms within a location with a clear indication that no. of heads represents the capacity for a better usability.</p>

                    <p>When user clicks on a room (i.e. Discussion Room 4), booking schedule for current month is displayed. User is able to make a new booking by clicking the orange “+” sign.</p>

                    <p>A window will pop up for new booking. We simplify the required user-input fields to Contact No., time and purpose to minimize user efforts.</p>

                    <p>If the user clicks ‘OK’, this window will be dismissed, and it will return to the monthly schedule page. If the user clicks “View Details”, he or she will be directed to “My Booking” page.</p>
                    <p>We made some changes to 'My Bookings' page. In our low fidelity design, after users successfully submit their new bookings, they will be directed to ‘My Bookings’ tab which displays the detailed information for this booking. However, during testing users feedbacked that it took too many steps for they to retrieve details of a past bookings. And bookings of different rooms are packed under ‘My bookings’ tab associated with different rooms which is very inconvenient.</p>

                    <p>We realised that there is a need for a page that summaries all past bookings for a particular user and this page should be easily accessible for the users before they enter into any new bookings. Therefore, we decided to replace ‘Logo View’ with ‘My bookings’ so that a user will be immediately given two options: view all past bookings and make a new booking when he selects ‘Book Facilities’.  Upon clicking on an entry, a window will pop up displaying details for that booking.</p>

                    <p><b>Compare Timetables</b><br/>For the high fidelity prototype of this function, we have retained the same structure of Comparing timetables amongst groups and with a friend. One of the main changes to this first view is the limit on the number of pax allowed for each comparison.</p>

                    <p>Add New Group:<br/>There are significant changes for the addition of a new group. Firstly, based on the findings from our usability testing, we have realized that asking users to input the matric numbers manually will provide room for many errors. Hence, we have opted to send out a link instead like many other existing applications such as Google Docs when they perform sharing of a document. Additionally, the privacy setting has been reduced to either Public or Closed as the Secret group is largely the same as Closed Group and require permissions.</p>

                    <p><b>Add Own Events and Reminders</b><br/>By clicking the “Add Event” button on the top left, a window pops up for the user to fill in the information of her own event. The field of location, reminder and description are not mandatory. <br/>Another use case that the user will be directed to this page is if they have selected the “Add Event” button from Figure 46 (Compute time slots) once they have formed a project group and common slots have been computed. By adding their own event within the scope of the group, this event becomes common amongst the group members and will be populated into all their respective timetables. </p>

                    <p>Before the event starting time, if the user signs in to her NUSMODS account, she sees a window automatically pops up, reminding her of the coming events. She can snooze the reminder or cancel it. If the reminder is snoozed, it will resume one hour later.</p>

                    <p>A function which seems to be easy to be implemented actually needs lots of considerations. Behind a successful product, there are multiple versions of prototypes. An open mindset for different opinions, continuous pursuit for better design and close attention to details are important for a designer.</p>

                    </section> 


                <section id="Summary">
                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Summary</h4>
                    <p>Design thinking methodology is key to ensuring that the final product is not only able to function effectively to meet user requirements but also user-friendly in interaction design. This project enables us to link different design concepts and techniques together and apply them into practices. Through different stages in our design process such as user study, usability testing and evaluation, we have continuously placed user’s needs and pain-points at the forefront. <br/>In addition to adopting a user centered design process, we have also kept in mind Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics that we’ve learnt in class when we are creating our prototypes to ensure that the product does not create even more frustration for the users. <br/>Products have to often undergo rounds of iteration and usability testing as there would be errors or points that we may not have noticed prior to testing.<br/>It is important to detach ourselves as users of the application, but instead empathize as designers through user centric methods like persona generation, storyboarding, empathy maps and customer journey maps.</p>

                <section id="Future">
                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Future Work</h4>   
                    <p>Development of a mobile version:The prototypes were solely designed for the web application of NUSMODS. With many users indicating their preference for a mobile version, by which they conveniently review the timetable and use other functionalities, designers shall develop on the mobile app in the future. Some key points of the design include handphone-friendly interface and mobile application interactions.<br/>Take measures to increase the number of module reviews: Many users mentioned the lack of module reviews in NUSMODS. The designers propose to enable anonymous reviews, thereby encouraging more reviewers.<br/>Make the module information more accurate & comprehensive: Module information should also be more accurate and up-to-date. Lecture information for the current semester should also be included. Currently, students have to search for module information on IVLE when planning their timetables on NUSMODS. The switching between different sites is time-consuming. Perhaps one future solution is to reach out to faculty departments for updated module descriptions, prerequisites and examination styles.</p>
