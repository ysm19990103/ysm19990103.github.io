                      <h2>Elements for successful children-oriented human computer interaction (HCI)</h2>
                      <p class="first">The digital era has witnessed a continuous increase in the frequency and duration of computer usage by children (Di Mascio & Tarantino). Due to the fact that children (2 years < age < 12 years) differ a lot from adults in terms of cognitive characteristics, children deserve to be studied as a separate user group (Markopoulos & Bekker, 2003). Successful children-computer interaction is important for children’s intellectual development, as well as physical and psychological health. While appropriate children-oriented HCI enhances children’s digital literacy and thinking skills (Hansen et al., 2012), badly-designed children software results in frustration and behavioral problems. Hence, this article pinpoints three essential elements for constructive children-centered interaction design, including strategies to capture children’s attention, children-friendly operations and children-specific safety measures.</p>

                    <p>As children have shorter attention span than adults, measures should be taken to attract children’s attention. Unlike adults, children usually do not force themselves to concentrate on things that do not interest them. Specifically, children tend to get bored of reading text very easily. Therefore, the use of visual stimulations such as pictures and comics help keep children focused (Hourcade, 2008). However, the neatness of the websites/software should not be sacrificed when incorporating pictures into the design. Particularly, each picture used must be at-point and carefully organized. Blindly putting unnecessary pictures is merely a distraction (Budiu & Nielsen, 2014). The National Geography Kids website is a good case in point. The colorful interface has lots of cute pictures. Upon clicking on a picture, kids can proceed to explore more about what is depicted by the picture. In addition, articles intended for kids to read should have shorter paragraphs and preferably one picture for every paragraph to aid kids’ understanding. Secondly, embedding human-like qualities into particular parts of the products is an effective strategy. Preece, Rogers, and Sharp (2015) explained children’s favor for dialog agent and helper tool with human-like features by anthropomorphism, people’s tendency to attribute human characteristics to digital objects. Human-like software helpers that wave their hands as humans do, address the users in the first person and have human feelings are popular among kids. For example, the helper Daji in the game Strike of Kings looks like a beautiful girl and accompanies new users to go through basic game zones.</p>

                    <p>Children-centered operation design is another important element for successful children software. Children are unable to perform complicated operations, especially at an early age. Firstly, children have difficulties precisely selecting a target. Therefore, big buttons are used instead of text for navigation (Budiu & Nielsen, 2014). Secondly, it is a common practice to split a big task into subtasks and turn abstract tasks into animated steps. For instance, Scratch is a suitable programming language for kids to create simple computer games on their own. It lowers the difficulty of programming by turning movement instructions into colorful boxes. Thirdly, kids lack patience when they are waiting for something to load and may click on a button for multiple times (Loranger & Nielsen, 2013). Hence, a system response should be given after the first click to ease the impatient kids. In summary, using big buttons, lowering down the level of abstraction and preventing duplicate operations make websites/software easier for children users.</p>

                    <p>The design should also take children’s security into consideration. It should protect children from the risk of inappropriate content, malicious contact and misconducts (Zhang-Kennedy, Mekhail, Abdelaziz, & Chiasson, 2016). Contents that are only suitable for adults should not appear in a children-oriented software, be it a part of design, a link or a pop-up advertisement. Moreover, children should be prevented from harassment from online predators with malicious motivations. With regard to risk of misconduct, the software/website should promote healthy and virtuous conduct. Children have a propensity to imitate what others have done. Since they have not completely established their own value systems, it is hard for them to distinguish the right from the wrong. Children who play improperly designed games with lots of bloody scenes tend to develop aggressive behaviors (Anderson & Bushman, 2001). Additionally, parent supervision function should be enabled for parents who are worried about their kids’ software usage. It can also serve as a rescue measure when kids have forgotten their passwords. For example, Mac allows users to create accounts with parental controls upon which restrictions on software and Internet usage are imposed by parents. In a word, an additional layer of online security protection measures should be implemented upon what has been done to protect adult users.</p>
                    <p>To conclude, it is advisable for designers to have children’s nature in mind when designing children-oriented products. Visual attraction, easy operation and security are necessary for constructive children-centered design.</p>
