                <h3 class="text-uppercase">Overview</h3>
                <p><span style="font-size:1.5em; font-weight: bold;"> I </span> am a karaoke enthusiast. I often hang out with my colleagues for karaoke after a long day of work. Although singing is not my forte <i>(unfortunately)</i>, I enjoy the process as it helps me to relieve stress and re-energize for the days to come. I would often conceal my terrible vocals by selecting songs that I am confident in singing whenever handed the mic. </p>
                <p>However, before I can get to sing, I would need to get past a couple of hurdles which involve the arrangement of time and venue. Depending on my location and knowledge of nearby vicinities, finding a suitable place to sing can sometimes be time-consuming and exhausting. Furthermore, locating one does not guarantee a time slot of my choice. Worst still, I would occasionally get hang up in the middle of a phone inquiry. The issues tend to get worse over the weekend and during peak hour.</p>
                <p>Having experienced all these, it is always my intention to devise a solution to improve the booking experience of those who enjoy singing karaoke. I later had an opportunity to conceptualize a product idea in CS3240– <i>Interaction Design</i>, the landmark class on UIUX design hosted by my school, to address the problems as mentioned. During this period, I researched, interviewed, prototyped and tested a digital product concept meant to assist karaoke goers in securing a place to sing.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Preliminary Research</h4>
                    <p>Before conducting an in-depth study of the problem, I performed a quick sanity check by asking others around me if they too face similar issues. Surprising, only a few had troubles with booking, <b>but most have problems finding a karaoke place nearby.</b></p>
                    <p>This is owed to the fact that booking is usually made on the spot rather than in advance. By visiting places that they most frequent, they are confident of making arrangements last-minute based on experience. However, the same cannot be said for places that they are unfamiliar with. When questioned if they are comfortable with other alternatives, a majority responded that they have no preference when comes to finding a place to sing provided that they are situated nearby. What was stopping them was their lack of knowledge about the vicinities that limits their choices. Otherwise, they are prepared to opt for nearby options to save them the trouble of traveling elsewhere (especially in big groups). The Google Maps is what they would count on for suggestions, but the experience can sometimes be unpleasant given the amount of information presented. Some even express discontentment with the images displayed on the app when they do not accurately reflect the actual location.</p>
                    <p>Other methods were mentioned as well, such as following the lead of others who are more experienced or banking on their chances to discover a new place in their search.</p>

              <section id="UserResearch">
                <h3 class="text-uppercase">User Research</h3>
                <p>To validate my preliminary findings, more thorough research needs to be conducted. As such, I surveyed both students and adults to find out the current problems that they face when going for karaoke. Then, with the focus on actual experience, I conducted several semi-structured interviews and contextual inquiries to gather more insights into their pains and needs. By adopting a user-centric approach to user research, I can ensure that production is lean, focusing on features that only matters to the users.</p>
                <p>The research is structured as follows:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    <li><b>i) Surveys</b>: Provides a general knowledge on the current situation. By exploring the different problems face by customers, I can identify trends and patterns that help me narrow down on the pivotal issues that demand attention.</li>
                    <li><b>ii) Semi-structured interview</b>: Once the problematic areas are defined, I need to pinpoint the exact cause of the problem by raising questions designed to lead me to those answers. In the process of doing so, I can also acquire a detailed description of their personal experience and make interesting discoveries that was not previously known to me.</li>
                    <li><b>iii) Contextual Inquiry</b>: Following the semi-structured interviews, it is necessary to witness the behaviors of the users to confirm that the issues persist among them. I would need to recruit several individuals whose task is to book a nearby karaoke place which I will shadow them along as they execute them. When in doubt, I would jump in and question their behavior to understand their mental states and rationale behind their decision. Information found useful will be documented on paper, and actions will be recorded on video for later reference. After the activity, both the experimenter and the subject will review the findings, sum up the overall experience, and follow up with any action or emotion in greater details.</li>
                </ul>

              <section id="Survey">
                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Survey</h4>
                    <p>The purpose of conducting a survey is to examine the different contexts a person would visit a karaoke place. Questions include the number of guests, choice of venue, timing as well as navigation methods. You can find the complete set of survey question <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tJVkSNbcDSdnPz4JonC9Z_qY_B7fnp2pDuQrgYVEFwE/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:blue">here.</a> Surveyees were also asked on the type of problems encountered and possible suggestions to improve the situation. Such questions were open-ended to collect qualitative feedback that were based on experience rather than perception. By designing the survey in this manner, respondents can better recall relevant experience followed by specific events that left a deep impression on them.</p>
                    <p>The survey was disseminated online through personal contacts and social media <i>(basically channel that are known to be cheap and quick)</i> with the following demographics kept in mind.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Survey Findings</h4>
                    <p>From the survey findings, I found out that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most respondents tend to frequent a karaoke place with four to six other people in the afternoon (3 - 5 pm) with each session lasting 2 to 3 hours. The most popular joints to visit were Teo Heng KTV Studio and Party World KTV due to its sheer number of outlets nationwide.</li>
                        <li>Current methods of finding a karaoke place are <i>passable</i> with most ratings lying between 4 to 6, with 10 being the easiest, suggesting much room for improvement. Locating a karaoke place is usually done based on prior experience (35%) or using navigation apps (34%). A handful of them (20%) also preferred finding their way around themselves with the help of mall directories situated in districts.</li>
                        <li>Booking a karaoke room is also far from perfect, scoring an average difficulty rating of 5.12 out of 10. Users generally suffered from missing details or unreachable hotline when making a phone inquiry.</li>
                        <li>Of all the booking methods presented, 63% chose to make phone calls, whilst 28% would rather to walk in without any prior reservation.</li>
                        <li>Despite the complications in booking, a majority felt that securing a suitable timeslot is relatively easy judging by the average difficulty rating of 8. The success rate is however, subjected to time and the popularity of the venue.</li>
                        <li>Other problems were brought up as well. Examples include vendor-related issues (i.e., price, operating hours, etc.) as well as UX flaws like the inability to track booking records.</li>
                        <li>When questioned if an app is useful in solving their problem, 56% were in favour of the idea, 36% remains sceptical and 8% rejected the initiative. The responses should however, be taken lightly as they are based on the participant’s existing knowledge about applications rather than the intended product. A product can only be accurately evaluated after released.</li>
                        <li>Considering everything, respondents gave an overall satisfactory rating of 7.5/10 (10 being very satisfied) for their experience with karaoke place (from searching all the way to arriving at the location).</li>
                    </ul>
              </section>
              <section id="SemiStructuredInterview">
                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Semi-structured Interview</h4>
                    <p>At the end of the survey, I invited three respondents to an interview to share their experiences based on their survey responses. The aim is to explore in-depth their lives, habits and the difficulties they faced.</p>
                    <p>The interviews conducted with the said participants are designed to be semi-structured. These are one-to-one interviews guided by prepared questions but remained open to being framed by their responses during the interview. As such, questions are likely to change and be adjusted in the process to ensure that problems encountered by users emerge from the users themselves.</p>
                    <p>The following sums up the interviewees' encounters, what they want and why.</p>
                    <figure>

              <section id="ContextualInquiry">
                  <p>The participants proceed to demonstrate their points through a contextual inquiry exercise, in which they would carry out several tasks as a group. I went to tag along and observe, taking down important pieces of information along the way.</p>
                  <p>By borrowing subjects of the same demographic from my interview, I am able to relate to their experience first-hand with the goal of building a deeper level of empathy of their problems. Should I be in doubt, I would raise questions directed towards their thoughts and feelings on-set. However, I needed to ensure that the process is non-intrusive to avoid any <i>Hawthorne Effect</i> where subjects knowingly performed due to my presence.</p>
                  <p>The task is specified as follows:</p>
                  <figure>

                  <figcaption> Figure 14: Task Specification</figcaption>
                  <p>I gathered a few friends to put together a short video to demonstrate the problems that were observed during the contextual inquiry. I figured out that the best way to do this is to emulate a similar scenario infused with some comical element.</p>

                  </div>
                  <p>The process was further mapped to a user journey map where I would break down and analyze each step in greater details. A user journey map is useful in highlighting the touchpoints a user has with the current method of securing a karaoke place from start to finish. It describes how a user thinks and feel in every scenario of the journey, revealing more insights into their mental models.</p>

                    <p>To make better use of the feedback gathered from my studies, I consolidated and categorized them into themes denoting a goal or problem into one place. Designers would usually refer to them as <i>affinities</i> where each affinity is captured onto a sticky note which would be moved around and grouped together. The idea here is to draw patterns to help determine the next actionable step.</p>

                    <p>From the diagram, the responses gathered ultimately ties back to the <b>experience</b> of going for karaoke. In other words, the intended product needs to focus on creating positive experience of going for karaoke by considering the following aspects that matters most to the users:</p>

                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Empathy Map</h4>
                    <p>After acquiring information from different types of users, I can now make use of the newfound learning to create an empathy map to represents the group of users that I will be designing for. The empathy-mapping process is known to help designers distill and synthesize their knowledge of users into one place. It is the collective voices and needs of those that I have interviewed. Doing so establishes a common understanding about the user, ensuring that a product stays in focus with the user’s needs. At the same time, it also enables the discovery of factors that drove the users’ behavior and other unexpected insights.</p>
                    <p>An empathy map is divided into four plus two quadrants, outlining notes on six different aspects (feelings, sights, actions, influences, problems, and goals), thus producing an overview of the person’s experience.</p>

                    <p>Using the empathy map, it is possible to transfer the information about the user to what is known as personas. By introducing specific traits and personalized experience to personas, I can create fictional characters whom my product would serve.</p>
                    <p>Each persona includes the basic element of the map areas, as well as additional, specific information about the imagined user.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-uppercase">Concept</h4>
                    <p>With the overarching idea of assisting users with securing a place to sing, I embarked on a mobile application concept, titled G6 to address the identified problems in my earlier studies. G6 is named after a song called <i>Like a G6</i> by Far East Movement due to its punk-ish vibe that took the world by storm back in 2010. The song is quick to rise in popularity, becoming one of the most requested songs to sing-along at clubs, karaoke, and disco bars.</p>
                    <p>It is the goal of G6 to bring together all aspects of visiting a karaoke place in one place. The idea is to streamline the process of finding and booking a karaoke place without having to rely much on multiple sources and applications – <i>think of it as a one-stop hub for all Karaoke needs.</i> The app is designed based on the following principles derived from the user responses.</p>
                    <p><b>i) Display results according to price and distance</b></p>
                    <p>Being the primary concern of the users, the app needs to introduce some ways to enable categorization and sortation based on meaningful metrics (i.e., distance and price) to hasten a search. For it to be effective, it needs to work with a sizeable result generated within a certain radius. Other filters such as popularity and amenities are equally important as well.</p>
                    <p><b>ii) Deals, promotions and discounts</b></p>
                    <p>Due to the overwhelming request for promotional campaigns and the common adoption of such practices, it is decided that G6 should have a dedicated section featuring the latest deals and promotions. With the idea of <i>Kiasuism</i>, often regarded as the fear of losing out to others being so prevalent in Singapore, it is not unusual to see people trying so hard to stay abreast of the latest news and promotions. Comparing prices across options has become part of the purchasing process. Users are quick to dismiss something as ‘expensive’ if they manage to find something cheaper elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>To accommodate this behavior, it helps to consolidate and flesh out a list of ongoing programmes which users can take advantage of. However, the terms and conditions of each campaign need to be explicitly stated to avoid disappointment. To take the idea of discount further, the app can consider the use of promo codes issued by participating vendors when checking out.</p>
                    <p><b>iii) Accurate and up-to-date information</b></p>
                    <p>Users generally hate the feeling of not being delivered the experience as promised on the internet. As such, it is important to present information that is salient to the users in a precise and cohesive manner. Factors such as user reviews, photos of the venue and featured amenities are what set the expectation about a place prior to a visit. Therefore, such content needs to be carefully curated and organized in a way that can be easily understood without any incongruity. Partnering vendors should also work together with designers to ensure that their information stays up to date especially for dynamic information such as date, time and prices.</p>
                    <p><b>iv) Provide direction and location on map</b></p>
                    <p>Many have expressed concern with navigation as GPS apps are sometimes confusing and unreliable. However, designing a brand-new way of navigating could introduce a steep learning curve especially when users are already familiar with how apps such as Google Maps or Apple Maps operate. Knowing this, it would be useful to tap on their existing knowledge using geo-location APIs that focuses on information relevant to a location. Users can expect to find the same information like address and directions as they usually would on a navigation app.</p>
                    <p><b>v) Ease of Booking and Management</b></p>
                    <p>Despite users not having many qualms about booking, it is a necessary feature for the app to be functional. The process should be kept as simple as possible, asking for only minimum information necessary for booking. As a general rule of the thumb, the process should be kept within five steps to ensure an optimal experience. </p>
                    <p>The paranoid nature of individuals like Gary Wong (User Persona 2) requires the app to contain a record of their booking. This is to provide some form of assurance regarding their purchases. Users may need to occasionally refer back to information like timeslot and price when prompted from time to time. The app should cater to post-booking woes by granting them the ability to manage their booking and performed any last-minute action like cancellation. This is also one of Nielson Jakob’s usability heuristic, <i>user control and freedom</i> – which designers need to pay attention to when designing.</p>

                <h4 class="text-uppercase">Storyboarding</h4>
                <p>To visualize how the core features of G6 would work, I drew a general workflow of each feature on a storyboard using pen and paper. A storyboard is a canvas broken down into a sequence of images arranged in chronological order. It illustrates the steps taken by users to achieve their goals. By breaking down a complex idea into small, procedural steps, designers can envision themselves as the users and reveal any flaws in their thinking.</p>
